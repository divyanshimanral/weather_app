The hosted link of website is here: <a href="https://weather-website-reactjs.netlify.app/">Weather website</a>

The provided code appears to be a React-based weather application. Here are the key features of the app:

1. <b>Weather Data Display:</b> The app allows users to enter a city name and fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the provided location. The fetched data includes information such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and more.

2. <b>Real-Time Updates:</b> The app uses the useEffect and useState hooks to fetch weather data from the API and update the UI in real time. The weather data is stored in the component's state using the useState hook, and the useEffect hook is used to trigger the data fetching process when the component mounts and when the location is updated.

3. <b>Dynamic Background:</b> The app dynamically changes the background image based on the weather conditions. It uses a set of predefined background images that correspond to different weather conditions such as rain, clear skies, clouds, mist, etc. The background image is updated based on the fetched weather data.

4. <b>Loader:</b> While the weather data is being fetched, a loading spinner is displayed to indicate that the data is being processed. The Loader component shows a GIF or image to provide visual feedback to the user.

5. <b>Error Handling:</b> If the entered city name is invalid or if there is an error while fetching the weather data, the app displays an error message and an option to try again. The ErrorFallback component is rendered in such cases, showing a message and an image.

6. <b>Clock Component:</b> The app includes a clock component that displays the current time. The Clock component uses the useEffect and useState hooks to update the time in real time.

Overall, this weather app allows users to search for weather information based on a city name, displays real-time weather data, provides a visually appealing background, and includes error handling and a clock component for additional functionality.
